# Description

Parquet Factory is a program that can read from several data sources, aggregate
the data received from them and generate a set of Parquet files with the
aggregated data, storing them in a S3 bucket.

It is used to generate different data aggregations in the CCX Internal Data
Pipeline,
reading data from Kafka topics.
